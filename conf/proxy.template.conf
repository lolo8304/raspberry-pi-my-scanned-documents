# If you only want to use apache2 as a reverse proxy/gateway in

# 'ProxyRequests On'.

# Switch Proxy On and install a reverse proxy pass to your local server on port 9200
# whener you change the port of elasticsearch - change it here.
# it is important to have this due to issues with CORS on REST services within angular.js
# I did not wanted to change it to JSONP - so a relative REST URL is important
